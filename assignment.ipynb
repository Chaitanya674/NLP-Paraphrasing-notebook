    "# Summary and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a **Custom Paraphrase Generator (CPG)** that compares multiple approaches for paraphrasing long-form text while maintaining semantic meaning and meeting a minimum length requirement of 80% of the original text.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Architectures Evaluated**\n",
    "- **T5-small**: Lightweight transformer-based seq2seq model\n",
    "- **T5-base**: Enhanced version with better contextual understanding\n",
    "- **T5-base (Chunked)**: Sentence-boundary-aware chunking strategy\n",
    "- **T5-base (Optimized)**: Fine-tuned parameters for improved coherence\n",
    "- **Ollama LLM (llama3.1:8b)**: Large language model-based paraphrasing\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Key Findings**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Performance Comparison:\n",
    "| Aspect | Observation |\n",
    "|--------|------------|\n",
    "| **T5-small** | Fast but struggles with long text; loses context and produces gibberish at the end |\n",
    "| **T5-base** | Significant improvement over small; better context retention but still truncation issues |\n",
    "| **T5-base (Chunked)** | Preserves semantic boundaries using sentence splitting; more coherent output |\n",
    "| **T5-base (Optimized)** | Best transformer approach with fine-tuned parameters; maintains 80%+ length requirement |\n",
    "| **Ollama LLM** | Superior semantic preservation; most natural paraphrasing; best at maintaining originality |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Why T5 Was Chosen**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sequence-to-Sequence Architecture**: Perfect match for \"text-in, text-out\" paraphrasing task\n",
    "- **Prefix-based Triggering**: Simple \"paraphrase:\" prefix enables task-specific generation\n",
    "- **Length Control**: Easy to enforce 80% minimum length via `min_length` parameter\n",
    "- **Encoder-Decoder Design**: Full transformer architecture captures complex linguistic patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Evaluation Metrics**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BLEU Score**: Measures n-gram overlap with original text\n",
    "- **ROUGE Score**: Evaluates recall and F1-measure against reference\n",
    "- **Semantic Similarity**: TF-IDF cosine similarity to assess meaning preservation\n",
    "- **Length Ratio**: Validates the 80% word count requirement\n",
    "- **LLM as Judge**: Multi-dimensional evaluation across 5 criteria:\n",
    "  - Semantic Preservation\n",
    "  - Lexical Diversity\n",
    "  - Fluency\n",
    "  - Coherence\n",
    "  - Originality\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaways**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Chunking Strategy Matters**: Breaking text by semantic boundaries (using SentenceTransformer embeddings) significantly improves output quality compared to naive truncation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Size Trade-off**: Larger models (T5-base) outperform smaller ones (T5-small), but computational cost increases. For production use, chunking can mitigate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **LLM Superiority**: Ollama's llama3.1:8b produces the most human-like paraphrases with superior semantic preservation and lexical diversity compared to fine-tuned transformers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Parameter Optimization**: Careful tuning of `num_beams`, `temperature`, `repetition_penalty`, and `length_penalty` is crucial for coherent outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Length Preservation**: All models successfully meet the 80% minimum word count requirement with proper parameter configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Test Case Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook validates all approaches on a **340-word cover letter** requiring minimum **272 words** in output:\n",
    "- All models met the length requirement\n",
    "- LLM approach achieved highest semantic similarity\n",
    "- Chunked T5-base maintained coherence across 4+ chunks"
